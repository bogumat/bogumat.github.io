    <p>Info: Winning project of the DesSoc Cities of the Future Hackathon. Data-specified generative architecture to automate environment-appropriate building. 24h Hackathon sprint.</p>
    <p>Problem: Architects can cost up to 16% of the cost of a new building, and our urban environments are getting polluted by sound and air particulates. Can we tune new buildings to improve the surrounding area?</p>
    <p>Solution: A set of proof-of-concept prototypes that take parameters to change the materials and characteristics of a building generated from a .PNG image of a floorplan.</p>
