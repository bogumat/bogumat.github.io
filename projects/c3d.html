    <p>Info: A faster, more efficient, and cheaper 3D printing automation solution (for a school project). In a team of 5, I had a role in ideating, designing, marketing, and prototyping of the product, as well as financial modeling of the potential business. More detail available on <a href="https://Continuum3D.XYZ">continuum3D.</a></p>
    <p>Problem: Shared 3D printer spaces are rife with user-error, inefficient use of space, low utilisation of printers, and staffing costs.</p>
    <p>Solution: By queuing prints and storing them via a gantry system, we can print around the clock and deliver more prints in a more timely manner, while removing the most common elements of user error.</p>
