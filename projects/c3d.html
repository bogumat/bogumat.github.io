      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>A faster, more efficient, and cheaper 3D printing automation solution (for a school project). In a team of 5, I had a role in ideating, designing, marketing, and prototyping of the product, as well as financial modeling of the potential business.

    <div class="problem">
      <h2>Problem:</h2>      
      <p>Shared 3D printer spaces are rife with user-error, inefficient use of space, low utilisation of printers, and staffing costs.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Solution: By queuing prints and storing them via a gantry system, we can print around the clock and deliver more prints in a more timely manner, while removing the most common elements of user error.</p>
