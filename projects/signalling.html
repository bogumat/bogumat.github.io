  <h1>POLARIS Autonamous Naval Signalling Solution</h1>

<p>Info: A day-time signaling solution for autonomous maritime vessels. The winning submission to the Ocean Infinity Hackathon.</p>
<p>Problem: "Day-shapes" are required by international maritime regulations - but require a sailor to change and set up.</p>
<p>Solution: By manipulating sheets of polarized film, POLARIS can make day-shapes appear and disappear with remote signaling.</p>
