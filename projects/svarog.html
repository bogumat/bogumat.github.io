    <p>Info: I led the experiment design team of Project Svarog - publishing in the <a href="https://bis-space.com/shop/product/jbis-076-03-0078/">Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</a>. Project Svarog is a student-run initiative of the Imperial College Space Society. Inspired by Oumuamua during my first term as Chair/President - how might we (as a student engineering group) send an object beyond our solar system?</p>
    <p>Problem: How might we (a student society) launch an object into Interstellar space within a reasonable time frame?</p>
    <p>Solution: A 3U CubeSat with a solar sail released on a trans-martian trajectory.</p>
